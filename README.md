<h1>NLP AI Engineer Portfolio: Showcasing My Expertise and Projects</h1>
<p align="justify">
  Embarking on March 31, 2023, this portfolio captures the essence of my transition from web development into the vast universe of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). As my expertise grows, so will this space, reflecting my evolving skills and contributions to the NLP community.</p><br>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Having originally rooted myself in web development, I've demonstrated expertise ranging from frontend staples like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery to backend powerhouses such as Spring Boot and MySQL. Today, I am fueled by a growing passion for AI and NLP.

While specific AI endeavors are on the horizon, I've dedicated this portfolio to showcase my upcoming NLP projects.<br><br><br>

All projects, both past and upcoming, can be accessed through my portfolio at the following URL: <!-- For a holistic view of my past achievements and future pursuits, visit my continuously updated portfolio: --> <br>
