<h1>NLP AI Engineer Portfolio: Showcasing My Expertise and Projects</h1>
<p align="justify">
  This is the beginning of my portfolio, where I aim to chronicle my journey and growth in the expansive domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This portfolio was initiated on March 31, 2023, and I will be continually updating it as I delve deeper into the NLP world.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p align="justify">
  While I've previously immersed myself in web development—showcasing skills from frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery, to backend frameworks like Spring Boot and MySQL—I am currently pivoting towards a passionate pursuit in AI and NLP.<br><br>
  
  Although I have yet to add specific AI projects, this space is reserved for the exciting and innovative NLP implementations I will embark on in the coming days. I invite you to join me on this transformative journey as I navigate through the complexities of linguistic patterns, algorithms, and the magic of machine learning.<br><br>

All projects, both past and upcoming, can be accessed through my portfolio at the following URL: <br>
